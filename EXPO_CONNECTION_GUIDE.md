# 📱 Expo Connection Guide - Alternative Methods

## Issue: QR Code Not Showing

If the QR code isn't appearing in terminal, here are **4 alternative ways** to connect:

---

## Method 1: Check Expo Web Interface

Expo automatically opens a web interface. Check your browser or open manually:

```
http://localhost:8081
```

Or:
```
http://localhost:19006
```

You should see the **Expo Developer Tools** with:
- QR code displayed
- Connection URL
- Device logs

---

## Method 2: Manual URL Entry (Easiest!)

1. **Find your computer's IP address:**
   ```bash
   ifconfig | grep "inet " | grep -v 127.0.0.1 | awk '{print $2}'
   ```
   Example output: `192.168.1.100`

2. **Open Expo Go app on your phone**

3. **Tap "Enter URL manually"**

4. **Type:**
   ```
   exp://192.168.1.100:8081
   ```
   (Replace with YOUR IP address)

5. **Press Go/Connect** ✅

---

## Method 3: Use Tunnel Mode (Works Everywhere!)

Tunnel mode creates a public URL that works even if you're on different networks:

```bash
cd /Users/pawkumar/Documents/pawan/learn/mobile
npx expo start --tunnel
```

Wait 30-60 seconds, you'll see:
```
› Metro waiting on exp://u-abc123.tunnel.exp.dev:80
› Scan the QR code above with Expo Go
```

**Advantages:**
- Works on any network
- No IP configuration needed
- Phone doesn't need to be on same WiFi

**Note:** First time might ask to install `@expo/ngrok` - say yes!

---

## Method 4: Direct Device Selection

If you have iOS simulator or Android emulator:

### iOS Simulator (Mac only):
```bash
cd /Users/pawkumar/Documents/pawan/learn/mobile
npx expo start
# Then press 'i' in terminal
```

### Android Emulator:
```bash
cd /Users/pawkumar/Documents/pawan/learn/mobile
npx expo start
# Then press 'a' in terminal
```

## 🔍 Troubleshooting: Why QR Code Isn't Showing

### Possible Reasons:

1. **Terminal window too small**
   - Make terminal window larger
   - QR code needs space to render

2. **Metro bundler still starting**
   - Wait 30-60 seconds
   - Look for "Metro waiting on..." message

3. **Port conflict**
   - Another process using port 8081
   ```bash
   lsof -ti:8081 | xargs kill
   npx expo start
   ```

4. **Expo CLI issue**
   - Try with `--clear` flag:
   ```bash
   npx expo start --clear
   ```

---

## ✅ Quick Fix: Use Web Interface

The **easiest solution** right now:

1. **Open your browser**
2. **Go to:** `http://localhost:8081`
3. **You'll see Expo DevTools** with:
   - Big QR code ✅
   - Connection URL
   - Device info
   - Logs

4. **Scan QR code** from the browser with Expo Go app!
